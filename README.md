## Introduction

Ancient letters and scripts hold invaluable historical and cultural significance. Deciphering these ancient languages not only helps unravel the mysteries of the past but also provides insights into civilizations and societies that have long been forgotten. However, the translation of such scripts is a challenging task that requires expertise and extensive manual effort.

This project presents a novel approach to tackle this challenge by employing deep learning techniques in combination with natural language processing. By training powerful neural networks on vast datasets of ancient letter samples, we aim to automatically recognize and translate these scripts, providing researchers and historians with a valuable tool for their studies.

## Features

- Recognition and translation of ancient letters using deep learning models
- Pre-trained models for various ancient scripts
- Support for multiple languages and character sets
- Easy integration with existing projects and systems
- Simple and intuitive interface

## Installation

To install the project and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/naveens01/Ancient-letter-recognition-ML
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd ancient-letters-recognition
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Download the pre-trained models and datasets:

   ```shell
   python download_models.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary modules:

   ```python
   import ancient_letters_recognition as alr
   ```

2. Load the desired ancient script model:

   ```python
   model = alr.load_model("egyptian-hieroglyphs")
   ```

3. Use the model to recognize and translate ancient letters:

   ```python
   text = model.recognize_letters(image_path="path/to/image.png")
   translation = model.translate_text(text)
   print(translation)
   ```

For detailed usage examples and additional functionality, refer to the [documentation](docs/).
